Try These Before Starting
----------------------------------------------

These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

    1.Two ways to move a div around on the page
    2.Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
    3.Identify the background color of an existing webpage
    4.Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    5.Center an element horizontally
    6.Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
    7.Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    8.Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)


"I think this will be a basic HTML & CSS mini project. I'm confident with some but not all of the requirements, especially alignment, moving div & 3 ways to include CSS. I should review CSS & HTML before this proj though -_-"
